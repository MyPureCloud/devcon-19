# Chat API Workshop

This project demonstrates basic usage of the [Guest Chat APIs](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/api/webchat/guestchat.html) to implement a custom WebChat interface in your own web site. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any build processes or frameworks other than jQuery to keep the example as simple as possible. The guest chat APIs can be used from any web, mobile, desktop or any type of app that is capable of making REST API requests and maintaining a WebSocket.
